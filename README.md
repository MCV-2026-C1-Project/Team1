# C1-PROJECT

## Initial Setup

Create a virtual environment to encapsulate the required installations.

1. In your project directory, create the environment:
```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
```
2. Upgrade pip, in case the versions do not coincide:
```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
3. Install the required packages:
```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Activate the environment (Windows):
```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> **Note:** Windows PowerShell may restrict running scripts by default. If activation fails, allow execution for the current session with:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
> ```

## Week 1

### Task 1: Image Descriptors

Run:
```powershell
python .\src\main.py
```

This script randomly selects one image and computes different histogram descriptors:
- Grayscale
- RGB
- HSV (one component per histogram)
- HSV grid (4×4 cells, 512 values)

### Task 2: Similarity Functions

All similarity formulas are implemented in `similarity_functions.py`, and fall into two groups:

| Type | Functions | Interpretation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Distances | Euclidean, L1, Chi-square | Lower value = more similar |
| Similarities | Histogram Intersection, Hellinger kernel, Cosine, Correlation | Higher value = more similar |

### Task 3: Retrieval and Evaluation

Run:
```powershell
python .\src\k_similarity.py
```

This script retrieves the top K museum images for each query by comparing image descriptors (Grayscale, HSV, RGB, HSV grid) using the similarity functions.

**Ranking order**
- Distances are sorted in ascending order.
- Similarities (Histogram Intersection and Hellinger kernel) are sorted in descending order. They are listed in the `SIMILARITY_FUNCTIONS` constant, used by `rank_museum_images`.

Sorting a similarity in ascending order would return the least similar images first (scores of 0), which is why this distinction is needed.

**Evaluation metrics**
- **AP@K** measures how accurately the relevant museum images are ranked within the top K results for a single query, using the ground-truth correspondences.
- **mAP@K** averages AP@K across all queries, allowing retrieval performance to be compared across descriptor methods and distance functions for K=1 and K=5.

### Task 4: Blind QST1 submission

From the project directory, give the folders containing the museum and test images:
```bash
python src/task4.py --museum ../../datasets/BBDD --queries ../../datasets/test_set/P1/qst1_w1
```

Both arguments accept relative or absolute image-folder paths. Only JPG/JPEG
files directly inside each folder are read. Queries are ordered by numeric filename ID. Museum IDs come from
filenames: `bbdd_00007.jpg` becomes integer `7`.

Each `result.pkl` contains a Python list of lists, with exactly 10 unique Python
integer museum IDs per query, ranked best first.

| Output under `results/week1/QST1/` | Descriptor | Default comparison |
|---|---|---|
| `method1/result.pkl` | Grayscale | Chi-square |
| `method2/result.pkl` | HSV | L1 |
| `method3/result.pkl` | RGB | L1 |
| `method4/result.pkl` | HSV grid | L1 |

Default comparisons come from the mAP@5 results in `results.txt`.
When color histogram scores tie, L1 is used.

To override the comparison for all four methods or change the output location:
```bash
python src/task4.py --museum data/BBDD --queries data/qst1_w1 --distance Hellinger --output-dir results/hellinger/week1/QST1
```

Available comparisons: `Euclidean`, `L1`, `Chi-square`, `Histogram Intersection`,
`Hellinger`, `Cosine`, and `Correlation`. Quote names containing spaces.
